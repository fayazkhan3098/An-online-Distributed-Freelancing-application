 "M-ployer" appears to be a platform designed for freelancers in India, offering them the opportunity to find work and for employers to find freelancers. It emphasizes the freedom and flexibility that freelancing offers compared to traditional full-time employment.

The platform allows freelancers to choose the type of work they do, the hours they work, their location, and the volume of work they take on. It also allows them to control their work relationships and workload.

One of the key features of M-ployer is its simplicity, making it easy for anyone to register as a freelancer or job poster. The platform aims to address the issue of freelancers not receiving the full payment for their services, which can happen on foreign freelancing sites that charge high service fees.

M-ployer is designed to keep revenue within India, specifically targeting unemployed individuals in rural and urban areas. It also includes a discussion forum to foster a friendly environment between employers and freelancers.
